I appreciate you asking for clarification! Essential does not mean that nannies are required to report for duty, and some surely will choose not to do so. Essential only means that nannies cannot be charged with violating a stay-home order should they choose to go to work. Hopefully https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/uncategorized/50428#essential explains it better than I can.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why is it that Charlotte area nannies, from what I understand from this post, won&#039;t be going to work if they&#039;re deemed essential? You state we are essential with great facts to back it up, but at the end say that nannies in Charlotte will be missing their charges. I&#039;m so confused.]]></description>
