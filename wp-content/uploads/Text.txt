Dear Ms. Levenbook:

Thank you for your email to the City of Durham and your questions about how the Mayor's Order affects the nanny profession.  The provision you appear to have referred to in your email relates to daycare facilities and does not apply to your inquiry.

Under the Order, home-based nanny services are permissible and may continue under the following provision:

p.  Home-based care and services. For adults, seniors, children, and/or people with disabilities, substance abuse, and/or mental illness, including caregivers and service providers, who may travel to a home to provide care and other in-home services, such as meal delivery.

The City continues to encourage social distancing and safety precautions to the extent practicable in the home-based care setting.  The City appreciates your organization's efforts to comply with the Mayor's Order.  If you have any additional questions, please let me know.

Sincerely,
Anna Davis
