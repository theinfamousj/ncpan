<p>In the United Kingdom, <a href="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/">there is a week in February devoted to the mental health of children</a>. We think this is fabulous! And so, we are doing our part to bring that week here to this side of the Atlantic.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/media/1554/cmhw-small.png" alt=""/></a><figcaption>Children&#8217;s Mental Health Week is <strong>7-13 February 2022</strong>.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This year&#8217;s theme is&nbsp;<strong>Growing Together</strong>. Growing Together&nbsp;is about growing emotionally and finding ways to help each other grow. Challenges and setbacks can help us to grow and adapt and trying new things can help us to move beyond our comfort zone into a new realm of possibility and potential. However, emotional growth is often a gradual process that happens over time, and sometimes we might feel a bit ‘stuck’. As caregivers/nannies, we play an important role in our charges&#8217; mental health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-re-participating">We&#8217;re participating!</h2>



<p>Our schedule of activities follows. As always, we&#8217;d love your photographs of works in progress or works completed. Sharing with other nannies is informal education and perhaps your charge and yourself can be the mentor this time.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Monday (7 February):</strong> <em>we introduce</em> Watch one <a href="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/growth-stories/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/growth-stories/">growth story</a> and use it to start a conversation with our charge(s) about growth and the different challenges we may face. <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/professional-development/50832/2">More information here.</a></li><li><strong>Tuesday (8 February):</strong> <em>who supports</em> With our charge(s) we will complete <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/9XVOnukmI5Y" target="_blank">this art activity</a> to help them think about who supports them to grow.</li><li><strong>Wednesday (9 February):</strong> <em>the hard thing</em> We will model to our charge(s) how to choose a difficult task. We will choose ours, and they must choose theirs. We then set aside an age/stage appropriate amount of time for us to each independently practice our chosen task. At the conclusion, we debrief about how we felt before, during, and after the task. We then use art materials to remind ourselves not to get distracted by dissuading feelings when we felt so much better after the practice. Resilience researcher Duckworth (2018) explains her rule in this short <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://globalleadership.org/videos/leading-yourself/the-hard-thing-rule" target="_blank">video</a>.</li><li><strong>Thursday (10 February):</strong> <em>already grown</em> With our charges(s) we will complete <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/zZ7oMeEE8NM" target="_blank">this art activity</a> to support our charge(s) to look back at their past growths. Success breeds success.</li><li><strong>Friday (11 February):</strong> <em>work-week close out</em> Watch a second <a href="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/growth-stories/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/growth-stories/">growth story</a> with our charge(s) and use it to start a conversation assessing how the activities this week have emboldened our charges to resiliently face the future. <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/professional-development/50832/2">More information here.</a></li><li><strong>Saturday (12 February):</strong> <em>professional development</em> Learn &#8220;How to Manage Your Child&#8217;s Emotions (and Your Own)&#8221; from <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/professional-development/50790" data-type="post" data-id="50790">the 2021 Happily Family Conference</a> via on demand encore for <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/product/promember" data-type="product" data-id="42361">Supporting Nannies</a>. <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/product/promember" data-type="product" data-id="42361">Supporting Nannies</a> who are logged in to their account will find the link here: [membership level=&#8221;1&#8243;]<a href="https://vimeo.com/670458923">https://vimeo.com/670458923</a>[/membership].

<p>Until now, in the United States, only the IRS bothered to define the job of &#8220;nanny&#8221; and for legal purposes we have been using that definition ever since. But you notice how that sentence started: until now. What has changed now? Everything!</p>



<p>The US Department of Labor through their O*Net (stands for &#8220;occupation network&#8221;) is looking to create a better definition of the occupation we know as &#8220;nanny&#8221;. And they want experienced nannies to tell them what it should be and correct their missteps on what it isn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>And here is how you can give your feedback: Send an email to <a href="mailto:mrobinson@onet.rti.org" data-type="mailto" data-id="mailto:mrobinson@onet.rti.org">Matt Robinson</a> at RTI International if you are someone who qualifies as an expert.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You know the North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies for our program of sending your employer a really great National Nanny Recognition Week postcard. <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/socializing/48916">We love seeing them posted in honored places</a> and love that our member nannies are recognized without having to do the uncomfortable and demanding thing of asking employers to recognize them. <em>Yuck, so awkward.</em></p>



<p>One thing we haven&#8217;t loved, though, is the breach of trust between a nanny and his/her employer family.</p>



<p>When you ask us to mail your employers a postcard, you must give us private information about your employers and their addresses.</p>



<p>While we always scrupulously honored this private information, using it only to mail out postcards and then annihilating all traces of it from the internet and from our own internal database, it nonetheless had to exist and had to be handed over.</p>



<p>We didn&#8217;t love that.</p>



<p>We are nannies, too. We know just how zealously you wish to guard your employers&#8217; information. We do the same.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">W<strong>e&#8217;ve solved it</strong>!</h2>



<p>Rather than providing us with information to mail your employer a postcard, we are providing <em>you</em> with a way to print and fold your own postcards.</p>



<p>They are still professionally designed, still from the <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/">North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies</a>, still informative rather than demanding, and still will not make you appear greedy or demanding. But now, you don&#8217;t need to tell us who you work for or where they live.</p>



<p>When you &#8220;buy&#8221; (it is $0, but we don&#8217;t know what other word to use) <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/product-category/national-nanny-recognition-week">the National Nanny Recognition Week post card</a> from the <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/product-category/national-nanny-recognition-week">Equipment Shop</a>, you will be sent a digital file to <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/professional-development/48550">print, fold, and glue</a>. Then address it and stick a single postcard stamp upon the post card and toss that bad boy in the mail and <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/socializing/48916">watch your employer hang the postcard in a place of honor</a> to help them remember to recognize you.</p>





<h2 class="wp-block-heading">NO</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">BREACH</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">OF</h2>

<p>Just another way the North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies is helping you be the very best nanny you can possibly be!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>&#8230; that&#8217;s nice, but I really liked having NC PAN mail the post card to my employers.</em></h3>



<p>We see you! And we have a solution for you. You can purchase a mailer add-on to your digital post card.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll print it. We&#8217;ll address it. And we&#8217;ll pop it in the mail for you so that you don&#8217;t have to fuss with post card stamps or recognizable handwriting.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll treat your employer&#8217;s address with the utmost of our usual data privacy: we scrub it from our minds, computers, and the internet as soon as we&#8217;ve addressed the post card for you.</p>
