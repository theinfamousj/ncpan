<p>In the United Kingdom, <a href="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/">there is a week in February devoted to the mental health of children</a>. We think this is fabulous! And so, we are doing our part to bring that week here to this side of the Atlantic.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/media/1554/cmhw-small.png" alt=""/></a><figcaption>Children&#8217;s Mental Health Week is <strong>7-13 February 2022</strong>.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This year&#8217;s theme is&nbsp;<strong>Growing Together</strong>. Growing Together&nbsp;is about growing emotionally and finding ways to help each other grow. Challenges and setbacks can help us to grow and adapt and trying new things can help us to move beyond our comfort zone into a new realm of possibility and potential. However, emotional growth is often a gradual process that happens over time, and sometimes we might feel a bit â€˜stuckâ€™. As caregivers/nannies, we play an important role in our charges&#8217; mental health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-re-participating">We&#8217;re participating!</h2>



<p>Our schedule of activities follows. As always, we&#8217;d love your photographs of works in progress or works completed. Sharing with other nannies is informal education and perhaps your charge and yourself can be the mentor this time.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Monday (7 February):</strong> <em>we introduce</em> Watch one <a href="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/growth-stories/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/growth-stories/">growth story</a> and use it to start a conversation with our charge(s) about growth and the different challenges we may face. <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/professional-development/50832/2">More information here.</a></li><li><strong>Tuesday (8 February):</strong> <em>who supports</em> With our charge(s) we will complete <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/9XVOnukmI5Y" target="_blank">this art activity</a> to help them think about who supports them to grow.</li><li><strong>Wednesday (9 February):</strong> <em>the hard thing</em> We will model to our charge(s) how to choose a difficult task. We will choose ours, and they must choose theirs. We then set aside an age/stage appropriate amount of time for us to each independently practice our chosen task. At the conclusion, we debrief about how we felt before, during, and after the task. We then use art materials to remind ourselves not to get distracted by dissuading feelings when we felt so much better after the practice. Resilience researcher Duckworth (2018) explains her rule in this shortÂ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://globalleadership.org/videos/leading-yourself/the-hard-thing-rule" target="_blank">video</a>.</li><li><strong>Thursday (10 February):</strong> <em>already grown</em> With our charges(s) we will complete <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/zZ7oMeEE8NM" target="_blank">this art activity</a> to support our charge(s) to look back at their past growths. Success breeds success.</li><li><strong>Friday (11 February):</strong> <em>work-week close out</em> Watch a second <a href="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/growth-stories/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/growth-stories/">growth story</a> with our charge(s) and use it to start a conversation assessing how the activities this week have emboldened our charges to resiliently face the future. <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/professional-development/50832/2">More information here.</a></li><li><strong>Saturday (12 February):</strong> <em>professional development</em> Learn &#8220;How to Manage Your Child&#8217;s Emotions (and Your Own)&#8221; from <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/professional-development/50790" data-type="post" data-id="50790">the 2021 Happily Family Conference</a> via on demand encore for <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/product/promember" data-type="product" data-id="42361">Supporting Nannies</a>. <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/product/promember" data-type="product" data-id="42361">Supporting Nannies</a> who are logged in to their account will find the link here: [membership level=&#8221;1&#8243;]<a href="https://vimeo.com/670458923">https://vimeo.com/670458923</a>[/membership].

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/national-nanny-recognition-week">National Nanny Recognition Week</a> is to shine a glorious spotlight on to the fact that we nannies exist and rock at our jobs. What better way than to do that fabulous job, en masse, in public. And so we will! Join a flash mob of nannies and their charges having an outing to a public play area where moms and dads and grandmas and grandpas and aunts and uncles and completely disinterested strangers can all bask in the awe of the awesomeness of the way that nannies handle such things.</p>
<p>Read below for details on how your region is planning to awesome-bomb in order to gain recognition.</p>
<h1>Triangle</h1>
<p><strong>Date and Time:</strong> Tuesday, September 25thÂ atÂ 10 am to 12 noon</p>
<p><strong>Location: </strong>newhope Church&#8217;s indoor play area called Hopetown</p>
<p>Bring snack and/or lunch, and a clean pair of socks for every charge, and come play in the gigantic indoor play structure for the older folks, or the toy filled room for the younger tots. This outing is free and while held in a religious building, is free of proselytizing and any other attempts at conversion. They are just being good neighbors and sharing their megachurch megabucks playstructure bounty with everyone around.</p>
<h2>Register and RSVP on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/512696242509550/">Facebook</a>, or by messaging <a href="mailto:theinfamousj@gmail.com">volunteer host Jen</a>.</h2>
<hr />
<p>Don&#8217;t see your region listed? Pick a place to play, such as a park or other play zone, and <a href="mailto:webmaster@ncpan.org">email the webmaster</a> and we&#8217;ll send people your way. It is as simple as that.</p>
