<p>Because we are still battling CoViD-19 and some places are heading into additional lockdowns while there are also group gathering restrictions still in place, the official international stance on interNational Nanny Training Day is to hold an entirely virtual/online asynchronous training day this year (April 17th; this Saturday). In addition, there will be a group live-stream on 17th April 2021 if OnDemand (asynchronous) doesn&#8217;t work for you. The asynchronous recordings will be available until 2nd May 2021. Plus, registered attendees will have access to a private Facebook group with additional content.</p>

<p>So what does this have to do with National Nanny Recognition Week? Well, if you&#8217;ll look at our <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/national-nanny-recognition-week#schedule">schedule of events</a> on <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/national-nanny-recognition-week" data-type="page" data-id="46569">the NC PAN National Nanny Recognition Week page</a>, you&#8217;ll see that every Saturday of NNRW, NannyCast provides the nanny-themed add-on pack to everyone for free as a NNRW treat. So you&#8217;ll be helping yourself learn and helping yourself play!</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll notice that our calendar looks a little bit different this year. That&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve had to swap in-person events for remote events. Hopefully those remote events will still prove enjoyable enough that we&#8217;ll all have fun attending!</p>

<p>In light of the measures put in place to &#8220;flatten the curve&#8221; to prevent an overload of high risk patients in hospitals, several of the North Carolina interNational Nanny Training Days have canceled or postponed. This post will keep a running tally of which days have done what, by alphabetical order of city. As always, <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=2u6mpgcko0qgcnepj726977a4c%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/New_York">the North Carolina Nanny Calendar</a> will be kept as accurate as possible.</p>



<p>Please keep in mind that venues and registration sites are not being as flexible with the current health emergency as we would like them to be, so if you are in the position to financially enable these event hosts to survive in order to provide quality training, please let them know that you are able to forego a refund or willing to accept a partial refund to compensate for deposit losses. No one is running interNational Nanny Training Day to make a profit. For your generosity, <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/">North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies</a> is awarding registered attendees of these events a gratis (that means free) <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/product/promember">year of membership</a>! Your event host will be able to provide you details of how to take advantage of that, if they haven&#8217;t already.</p>

<p>The North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies has been asked to facilitate and administer scholarship admissions to interNational Nanny Training Day: Chapel Hill. We have a <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/product/scholarship-donation-for-inntd-chapel-hill">scholarship fund collection point</a> for anyone who wishes to donate to the scholarship fund.</p>




<div class="wp-block-button aligncenter"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/product/scholarship-donation-for-inntd-chapel-hill">Shop now</a></div>




<p>As stated on the donation collection point, every $50 donated is going to get some lucky nanny in the door at iNNTD: Chapel Hill for free! In addition, your North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies will go one step further and award all recipients of the scholarship fund with a year&#8217;s free <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/product/promember">membership</a> to NC PAN.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p>In order to be fully transparent, we are collecting scholarship applications here. In addition, we will discuss our scholarship strategy: We will attempt to award full scholarships primarily. For every $50 raised, someone gets in for free.</p>



<p>Should we have an odd amount of money raised that is not divisible by $50, we will portion out the remainder equally across all applicable scholarship candidates. While this won&#8217;t be a full scholarship, it will still be a reduced tuition fee. We ask that candidates who cannot, even at a reduced price, afford the tuition fee please let us know so that we can see that the scholarship funds we&#8217;d earmarked to those candidates are re-directed to serve other candidates.</p>
</div></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Apply for iNNTD: Chapel Hill Scholarship</h2>



<p>We are aware that not everyone is currently employed as a nanny. We have two different forms depending on whether or not a nanny is currently employed, as the information gathered will help us better develop resources so that nannies don&#8217;t need to pay out of pocket to attend iNNTD. Information provided here will not be shared with employers, potential employers, nor the agencies that are producing the interNational Nanny Training Days. It is for internal NC PAN resource development use only.</p>



<p>Applicants found to be providing false information will be deemed ineligible for scholarship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes it can be daunting to ask your employer to sponsor your admission to interNational Nanny Training Day. It is a lot easier when the <a href="http://www.ncpan.org/" rel="nofollow">North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies</a> makes the suggestion. We understand. We are nannies, too.</p>
<p>We are more than happy to send an email to your employers informing them of interNational Nanny Training Day&nbsp;and making a case for why they should pay to send you. All we ask in return is that you provide us with a way to reach your employer(s).</p>
<p>We will use this information ONLY to reach out to them about this year&#8217;s&nbsp;interNational Nanny Training Day, and only reach out to them once. We will not save, sell, or otherwise misuse this information. It is important and, as nannies ourselves, we take our own employer&#8217;s contact information very seriously, so we will extend the same courtesy to yours. (Plus, we have a great track record of meaning what we say about this &#8212; just look at our <a href="http://www.ncpan.org/national-nanny-recognition-week.html" rel="nofollow">National Nanny Recognition Week</a> postcards!)</p>
<p>Help us help you!</p>




<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rather do it yourself?</h2>



<p>Use <a href="http://www.ncpan.org/professional-development/why-employers-should-pay-for-nntdrtp-2015">this handy flyer</a> as an icebreaker for a great conversation! Then point your employer(s) to <a href="http://www.nannypalooza.com/nntd-events-by-city.html">the national listing of interNational Nanny Training Days</a> to complete the ticket purchase process.</p>

<p>Greetings NC PAN Members,</p>
<p>It is once again time for interNational Nanny Training Day and we are excited to note that some of the local training days are offering members a discount on the admission fee. The official North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies stance on iNNTD attendance is that local networking is the more important half of the conference attendance, so we encourage you to attend an event closest to where you work. That said, we understand that sometimes finances are in control of the decision so we are pleased to let you know the training days that will offer you a discount due to <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/product/promember">your NC PAN membership</a>. (in alphabetical order of city)</p>
<h2><a href="https://inntdchapelhill.regfox.com/international-nanny-training-day-chapel-hill?fbclid=IwAR0ojluHqS_g1qXaoUG8ymB2JOSEfi4BolgS56n4G4KN2Qd7sTwxF9cxwvg"><span style="color: #800080;">Chapel Hill via Nanny Posse, LLC</span></a></h2>
<p>NC PAN members will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>a discounted ticket price</li>
<li>extended Early Bird ticket pricing</li>
</ul>
<p>Discount and extension are available by individualized coupon code. Check the email address associated with your NC PAN membership for your individual code. Codes can only be used once and are tied to your identity so no sharing (but you can help your nanny friends advocate for why their <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/product/gift-membership-to-north-carolina-professional-association-of-nannies">employers should cover their membership fees to NC PAN</a>).</p>


<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Are you hosting a local iNNTD and would like to give our members a discount? If so, do we have a door prize for you! Contact <a href="mailto:nntd@ncpan.org">nntd@ncpan.org</a> to be added to the above list.</p></blockquote></figure>
