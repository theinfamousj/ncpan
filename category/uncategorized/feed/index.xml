<p>In the United Kingdom, they&#8217;ve been celebrating Children&#8217;s Mental Health Week for several years. We would like to do our part in bringing that celebration to this side of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>



<p>The theme for this year&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Mental Health Week is <strong>Growth Together</strong>. For us that means educational content for nannies and charges about growth mindset and resilience. We have a whole week of programming planned for the nannies of North Carolina.</p>



<p>And we have collaboration opportunities available for you!</p>

<p>To Whom it May Concern at Apple, Inc.:</p>



<p>We have become aware that in the latest update of iOS, there has been an autocorrect entry to turn the word referring to a collective of domestic employees: <em>nannies</em> into the possessive word: <em>Nannie&#8217;s</em>. While we do not deny that there may be several persons in the world named Nannie who may in fact own things, we doubt this is the usual case for the use of the word <em>nannies</em> given the scope and depth of the in-home childcare industry.</p>



<p>We are aware that additional steps may be taken to enter the automatic word-substitution dictionary to change the entry offered as a default by you. We find this insufficient. We know that your dictionary can learn new words and if the typer does indeed mistype objects belonging to Nannie regularly, that their phone will learn.</p>



<p>We respectfully request that this <em>nannies <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/27a1.png" alt="âž¡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Nannie&#8217;s</em> autocorrect entry be removed in the next planned update.</p>



<p>Yours,<br />The North Carolina Professional Association of <s>Nannie&#8217;s</s> Nannies</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>We, further, call upon other nanny organizations and individual nannies to join us in our call for Apple to correct their autocorrect error. Turn the page for ways <em>you</em> can help!</p>

<p>According to Governor Cooper, we are already in Phase 1b.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/1916783241941986/posts/3020763344877298/?app=fbl">According to Senator Jackson</a>, we should expect vaccinations to start on the 24th of February.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The vaccination delivery is being done on a county-by-county basis even though as a state it was decided where nannies place into the groupings and subgroupings and even though as a state it was decided that we are in Phase 1b. To illustrate this, at the time of writing this post, Wake County has announced to its county residents that it is still in Phase 1a despite the Governor due to supply shortages. So it is all a big mess.</p>



<p>We here at your North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies hope to provide an informational clearing house about this vaccination extravaganza of confusion. We cannot do this alone. If you know what your county is up to, please let your local nanny community know and also please let us know so that we can add it to this post for any nannies who haven&#8217;t been connected with your local community yet. How to let us know? Leave a comment.</p>

<p>Governor Roy Cooper gave a press conference today (Friday, April 24th) at lunch time. He said a lot of things, but only one that related to nannies and it is:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.heraldsun.com/news/coronavirus/article241422651.html?fbclid=IwAR0JHPae1QyKybpcq0FC-uQxPLPfpOG0S3I22u-d7zWsQn6h1PvydJYai8c">Public schools are all the way out for the whole rest of the school year</a>.</h3>



<p>For those of you with school aged charges, we know that adding Governess to your nanny title wasn&#8217;t something you wanted forced upon you, and especially not without additional pay. We get it. So if you haven&#8217;t seen the <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/socializing/50391">mental health resources for nannies</a> in this trying time, take ample advantage of them. You deserve it.</p>



<p>In addition, fire up your ongoing draft copy of your resume and RIGHT NOW add Governess to your position title at your current position. It is what you are doing.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>governess (noun) â€” a woman who is employed to take charge of a child&#8217;s upbringing, education, etc.</p><cite><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/governess">Dictionary.com</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Like it or hate it, we&#8217;ve just gained ourselves a resume booster because that &#8220;education&#8221; piece has fallen to us. So capture it before it gets forgotten and immortalize it on that resume!</p>

<p>They discussed the Families First Corona Virus Response Act, the Payroll Protection Act, the difference between a furlough and being laid off, unemployment insurance, what happens if you&#8217;ve been paid under the table (finger wagging <em>but also</em> solutions), and the stimulus money provided to every American earning less than $75,000/year.</p>
