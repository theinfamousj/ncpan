<p>Because we are still battling CoViD-19 and some places are heading into additional lockdowns while there are also group gathering restrictions still in place, the official international stance on interNational Nanny Training Day is to hold an entirely virtual/online asynchronous training day this year (April 17th; this Saturday). In addition, there will be a group live-stream on 17th April 2021 if OnDemand (asynchronous) doesn&#8217;t work for you. The asynchronous recordings will be available until 2nd May 2021. Plus, registered attendees will have access to a private Facebook group with additional content.</p>

<p>Nannies have been eligible for vaccination since Wednesday and we can now confirm that most counties, pharmacies, and hospital systems are vaccinating nannies; the hold outs are still in Group 2 and have nothing to do with nannies, specifically.</p>



<p>We have heard minor, isolated, incidents of uninformed individuals who &#8220;aren&#8217;t sure if nannies qualify&#8221;. Don&#8217;t back down under a challenge like this; nannies ARE eligible and any person challenging this benefits from checking so as to learn to better serve the public. Most of the ignorance comes from not realizing that nannying is a full time profession different from occasionally babysitting. We experienced nannies are no strangers to this misconception.</p>



<p>In the event that you don&#8217;t want to have to be an ambassador for the profession and fear you will find yourself in one of these isolated moments of push back, you can have your employers fill out an employment verification letter found here</p>



<div class="wp-block-file"><a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/wp-content/uploads/Nanny_Vaccine_Letter.docx">Nanny Vaccine Letter</a><a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/wp-content/uploads/Nanny_Vaccine_Letter.docx" class="wp-block-file__button" download>Download</a></div>



<p>Please let us know of any entities that are vaccinating Group 3 who are denying nannies, even after seeing the letter or checking their facts, by dropping a comment. We will be happy to educate them so all nannies benefit.</p>

<p>According to Governor Cooper, we are already in Phase 1b.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/1916783241941986/posts/3020763344877298/?app=fbl">According to Senator Jackson</a>, we should expect vaccinations to start on the 24th of February.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The vaccination delivery is being done on a county-by-county basis even though as a state it was decided where nannies place into the groupings and subgroupings and even though as a state it was decided that we are in Phase 1b. To illustrate this, at the time of writing this post, Wake County has announced to its county residents that it is still in Phase 1a despite the Governor due to supply shortages. So it is all a big mess.</p>



<p>We here at your North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies hope to provide an informational clearing house about this vaccination extravaganza of confusion. We cannot do this alone. If you know what your county is up to, please let your local nanny community know and also please let us know so that we can add it to this post for any nannies who haven&#8217;t been connected with your local community yet. How to let us know? Leave a comment.</p>

<p>Despite the timeline set by Governor Cooper, it appears this county is still in Group 2 and hasn&#8217;t expanded to Group 3. When this happens it is usually due to short supply.

<p>From Lora Brawley of Nanny Care Hub comes a Zoom chat on whether or not, and how, ask for a COVID raise. We&#8217;ll let her take it from here:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>In the beginning of the pandemic, lots of nannies picked up extra duties because the nation was on stay-at-home orders and often, they were the only professional allowed in the house. Housekeepers, dog walkers, chefs, and others were asked to stay at home. Schools and preschools closed and all of a sudden, they were in charge of virtual learning too. Most nannies didn’t ask for a raise during that time because people assumed (hoped!) it was temporary. However now we know we’re not going back to “normal” and many nannies are trying to figure out how their new responsibilities and work environments affect their hourly wage and benefits. Join me as we unpack this issue and talk about the if, when, how, and how much of a COVID raise.</p><cite>Email Announcing Event</cite></blockquote>



<p>You may choose to attend this event in person, or a recording of the event will be provided 24 hours after the chat. The same registration is required for both.</p>



<p>The event will take place on Saturday July 12th starting at 8 pm ET.</p>

<p>Governor Roy Cooper gave a press conference today (Friday, April 24th) at lunch time. He said a lot of things, but only one that related to nannies and it is:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.heraldsun.com/news/coronavirus/article241422651.html?fbclid=IwAR0JHPae1QyKybpcq0FC-uQxPLPfpOG0S3I22u-d7zWsQn6h1PvydJYai8c">Public schools are all the way out for the whole rest of the school year</a>.</h3>



<p>For those of you with school aged charges, we know that adding Governess to your nanny title wasn&#8217;t something you wanted forced upon you, and especially not without additional pay. We get it. So if you haven&#8217;t seen the <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/socializing/50391">mental health resources for nannies</a> in this trying time, take ample advantage of them. You deserve it.</p>



<p>In addition, fire up your ongoing draft copy of your resume and RIGHT NOW add Governess to your position title at your current position. It is what you are doing.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>governess (noun) — a woman who is employed to take charge of a child&#8217;s upbringing, education, etc.</p><cite><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/governess">Dictionary.com</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Like it or hate it, we&#8217;ve just gained ourselves a resume booster because that &#8220;education&#8221; piece has fallen to us. So capture it before it gets forgotten and immortalize it on that resume!</p>
