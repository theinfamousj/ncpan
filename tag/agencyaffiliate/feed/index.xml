<p>Greetings Agency Affiliates! We are hoping to collaborate with one of you to throw our annual WinterFest holiday bash (and All Members Meeting).</p>

<p>In return, you will get as much or as little publicity by name as you want, as well as programming control for one hour and fifteen minutes of the WinterFest celebration. The schedule will be as follows:</p>



<p>5:30 pm (15 minutes) All Members Meeting in a breakout room for members / Your choice of programming in the main room.<br />5:45 pm (15 minutes) Awards ceremony. Breakout rooms closed.<br />6 pm (1 hour) Your programming.<br />7 pm (2 hours) Nanny movie.</p>



<p>We will offer you gratis memberships and discounts to the <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/shop" data-type="URL" data-id="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/shop">Equipment Shop</a> to give out as awards if you choose to do games during your programming.</p>



<p>Once again, please do get in touch with <a href="mailto:social@ncpan.org">social@ncpan.org</a> if this sounds like a collaboration you are interested in.</p>

<p>The North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies is a proud, logo-showing member of the Fair and Legal Pay partners. And the movement is looking for more agency partners. If you haven&#8217;t already signed up to be a partner with them, consider doing so. You add the logo to your website, and your website&#8217;s logo to their page, and this alerts anyone who is looking for illegal labor that they are not welcome with you.</p>



<p>Go to <a href="https://fairandlegalpay.com/">FairAndLegalPay.com</a> and sign up today!</p>
