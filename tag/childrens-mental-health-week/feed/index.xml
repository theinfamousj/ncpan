<p>This workshop series is just the kind of thing we love to attend because it is evidence and science based to provide data driven parenting techniques and information. Plus, it is coincidentally during <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/tag/childrens-mental-health-week">Children&#8217;s Mental Health Week</a> (well, most of it anyway).</p>

<p style="font-size:14px">Here is the pitch that Happy Family makes for what you will learn in the workshop series:</p>



<p>If your child is struggling, parenting didn’t cause it, the pandemic did.<br /></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>What kind of parenting do kids need right now to recover from the pandemic? What are the best practices for moving forward?</li><li>How to address challenging behavior.&nbsp;Kids&#8217; mental and emotional health affects their behavior. How can you change behavior from the inside-out?</li><li>Parenting is protective. What does the research say about practices that protect the children’s well-being and improve their mental health?</li></ul>



<p>The workshop sessions are:</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom, <a href="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/">there is a week in February devoted to the mental health of children</a>. We think this is fabulous! And so, we are doing our part to bring that week here to this side of the Atlantic.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/media/1554/cmhw-small.png" alt=""/></a><figcaption>Children&#8217;s Mental Health Week is <strong>7-13 February 2022</strong>.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This year&#8217;s theme is&nbsp;<strong>Growing Together</strong>. Growing Together&nbsp;is about growing emotionally and finding ways to help each other grow. Challenges and setbacks can help us to grow and adapt and trying new things can help us to move beyond our comfort zone into a new realm of possibility and potential. However, emotional growth is often a gradual process that happens over time, and sometimes we might feel a bit ‘stuck’. As caregivers/nannies, we play an important role in our charges&#8217; mental health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-re-participating">We&#8217;re participating!</h2>



<p>Our schedule of activities follows. As always, we&#8217;d love your photographs of works in progress or works completed. Sharing with other nannies is informal education and perhaps your charge and yourself can be the mentor this time.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Monday (7 February):</strong> <em>we introduce</em> Watch one <a href="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/growth-stories/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/growth-stories/">growth story</a> and use it to start a conversation with our charge(s) about growth and the different challenges we may face. <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/professional-development/50832/2">More information here.</a></li><li><strong>Tuesday (8 February):</strong> <em>who supports</em> With our charge(s) we will complete <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/9XVOnukmI5Y" target="_blank">this art activity</a> to help them think about who supports them to grow.</li><li><strong>Wednesday (9 February):</strong> <em>the hard thing</em> We will model to our charge(s) how to choose a difficult task. We will choose ours, and they must choose theirs. We then set aside an age/stage appropriate amount of time for us to each independently practice our chosen task. At the conclusion, we debrief about how we felt before, during, and after the task. We then use art materials to remind ourselves not to get distracted by dissuading feelings when we felt so much better after the practice. Resilience researcher Duckworth (2018) explains her rule in this short <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://globalleadership.org/videos/leading-yourself/the-hard-thing-rule" target="_blank">video</a>.</li><li><strong>Thursday (10 February):</strong> <em>already grown</em> With our charges(s) we will complete <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/zZ7oMeEE8NM" target="_blank">this art activity</a> to support our charge(s) to look back at their past growths. Success breeds success.</li><li><strong>Friday (11 February):</strong> <em>work-week close out</em> Watch a second <a href="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/growth-stories/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.org.uk/growth-stories/">growth story</a> with our charge(s) and use it to start a conversation assessing how the activities this week have emboldened our charges to resiliently face the future. <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/professional-development/50832/2">More information here.</a></li><li><strong>Saturday (12 February):</strong> <em>professional development</em> Learn &#8220;How to Manage Your Child&#8217;s Emotions (and Your Own)&#8221; from <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/professional-development/50790" data-type="post" data-id="50790">the 2021 Happily Family Conference</a> via on demand encore for <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/product/promember" data-type="product" data-id="42361">Supporting Nannies</a>. <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/product/promember" data-type="product" data-id="42361">Supporting Nannies</a> who are logged in to their account will find the link here: [membership level=&#8221;1&#8243;]<a href="https://vimeo.com/670458923">https://vimeo.com/670458923</a>[/membership].
