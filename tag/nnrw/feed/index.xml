So you&#8217;ll be helping yourself learn and helping yourself play!</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll notice that our calendar looks a little bit different this year. That&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve had to swap in-person events for remote events. Hopefully those remote events will still prove enjoyable enough that we&#8217;ll all have fun attending!</p>

<p>For <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/national-nanny-recognition-week">National Nanny Recognition Week</a> 2018, we started a new tradition. Using the board game Munchkin, the most appropriate board game for nannies, we held <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/socializing/49271">a test marathon in the triangle region</a>.</p>
<p>What an amazing success! We had a tie for Marathon Champion, and luckily, we were prepared.</p>
<p>See the winners and more in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/520733745054781/?active_tab=discussion">the discussion section of our Facebook event page</a>.</p>
<p>Next year, if we have willing volunteers for other regions, we will roll this event out to other regions of North Carolina. If this already sounds like something you are interested in and you live outside of the Triangle, drop us a line (comment on this post, <a href="mailto:treasurer@ncpan.org">send an email</a>, write us a letter, etc.). Hosts get thank you swag.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/national-nanny-recognition-week">National Nanny Recognition Week</a> is to shine a glorious spotlight on to the fact that we nannies exist and rock at our jobs. What better way than to do that fabulous job, en masse, in public. And so we will! Join a flash mob of nannies and their charges having an outing to a public play area where moms and dads and grandmas and grandpas and aunts and uncles and completely disinterested strangers can all bask in the awe of the awesomeness of the way that nannies handle such things.</p>
<p>Read below for details on how your region is planning to awesome-bomb in order to gain recognition.</p>
<h1>Triangle</h1>
<p><strong>Date and Time:</strong> Tuesday, September 25th at 10 am to 12 noon</p>
<p><strong>Location: </strong>newhope Church&#8217;s indoor play area called Hopetown</p>
<p>Bring snack and/or lunch, and a clean pair of socks for every charge, and come play in the gigantic indoor play structure for the older folks, or the toy filled room for the younger tots. This outing is free and while held in a religious building, is free of proselytizing and any other attempts at conversion. They are just being good neighbors and sharing their megachurch megabucks playstructure bounty with everyone around.</p>
