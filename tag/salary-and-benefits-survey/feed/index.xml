										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year, the <a href="http://nanny.org/">International Nanny Association</a> polls as many nannies as it can reach about their salary and benefits. This year&#8217;s results are out! Here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agencies are no longer the way to find families (down 12% in five years), but that isn&#8217;t sending people to Care or Craigslist. Word of mouth is becoming key.</li>
<li>But that said, more nannies than ever have written work agreements (up 6% in five years) which they negotiated directly with the parents.</li>
<li>Nannies are congregating on Facebook (up 27% in three years) which is why <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/">North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies</a> offers a <a class="thirstylink" title="Facebook Group" href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/recommends/facebook-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">member&#8217;s only Facebook support group</a> in addition to <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/forum-nanny">the forums located on NCPAN.org</a></li>
<li>Exactly half of the nannies are payed by a payroll service (up 15% in five years), and we can certainly recommend some.</li>
<li>Not surprisingly, the two payroll services that invest the most into supporting professional development for nannies are the two that are most used: <a href="https://www.homeworksolutions.com/">HomeWork Solutions Inc Household Payroll Services​</a> and <a href="http://www.myhomepay.com/">Homepay​ (formerly Breedlove)</a>.</li>
<li>The average rate for a professional nanny in North Carolina is $16/hr.</li>
<li>North Carolina has two main market hotspots: the Triangle and the greater Charlotte area, though <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/category/socializing">we have identified five regions that all employ nannies and attempt to find volunteer event hosts in all of them</a>.</li>
<li>North Carolina&#8217;s nanny market is equivalent to that of Ohio in terms of pay and concentration of local markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here is a link to all the results: <a href="http://nanny.org/production/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017-INA-Nanny-Salary-Benefits-Survey-FINAL.pdf">http://nanny.org/production/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017-INA-Nanny-Salary-Benefits-Survey-FINAL.pdf</a></p>
