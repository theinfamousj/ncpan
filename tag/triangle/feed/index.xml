<p>In Durham, on <strong>Wednesday, August 17th at 10 am</strong>, there will be a free skills refresher for CPR. It does not include certification.</p>



<p>This is a great opportunity to refresh your own CPR skills or to send to employers who may not be interested in becoming fully certified but want some hands on practice. Attendees will need to wear face masks as a disease prevention protocol.</p>

<p>There is a new Facebook group for public nanny nights out in the Triangle area of NC. It is ONLY for nanny nights out. So if you want to invite people to your nanny night out or want to find a nanny night out, join the group and add the resource to your toolkit. As explained by the group founder:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>&#8230; I thought it would be a good idea to have a list of all the PUBLIC NC Triangle Nannies&#8217; Night Out events. This group is ONLY for public events &#8230; have fun and socialize with others in the NC nanny community.</p><cite>Genia S</cite></blockquote>



<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/851781805284015/">Visit the group on facebook</a></div>



<p>Events from that group will be appearing in the unified North Carolina Nanny Calendar that is maintained by the North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies. You can find it on the bottom of any page on the NC PAN website, as the first menu entry under the &#8220;Events&#8221; heading in the menu, at <a href="http://calendar.ncpan.org/">calendar.ncpan.org</a>, or can have it added to your phone or Google Calendar for ease of use.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>If your events have not been featured on the North Carolina Nanny Calendar and you would like them to be, send an email to <a href="mailto:social@ncpan.org">social@ncpan.org</a> to have them added. We love to help you spread the word!</p>
