<p>Now, it goes without saying that there must be some rules to keep everyone honest, and those are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only flyers posted to <em>community</em> (everyone has a fair chance to have their flyer posted) bulletin boards count.</li>
<li>Only <em>indoor</em> community bulletin boards. (no one wants the lovely flyer to be destroyed in the first rain storm) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/22511681@N02/2188506884/">This type of bulletin board</a> counts as &#8220;indoor&#8221; no matter where it is mounted, due to the doors.</li>
<li>Only post flyers to community bulletin boards after <em>receiving the explicit permission</em> of the business owner or manager. You are following our rules, so don&#8217;t break their rules!</li>
