<p><strong>1. This is the month, and you still don&#8217;t have <a href="http://go.ncpan.org/2017NNTDRTP">your ticket</a> to National Nanny Training Day: Research Triangle Park!</strong></p>
<p>You are going to miss out!</p>
<p>Meeting other nannies over our networking lunch sponsored by <a href="http://mygirlfri.com/">My Girl Friday</a>, is a great way to build up your professional network. You can rely on your professional network for coverage on days when you are sick or traveling. Plus, playdates with fellow nannies are always great!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Put the needs of others before your own.</strong></p>
<p>This is <em>exhausting</em>! Compassion fatigue is tiring and once you are in its clutches, it isn&#8217;t easy to break out. Luckily, <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/professional-development/48584">we have just the woman for the job</a>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Live paycheck to paycheck.</strong></p>
<p>Not only does that add stress to your life, but can add tension to the employer-employee relationship. Attending <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/2017-nntdrtp/nntd-schedule">our session on Financial Fitness</a> can free you from that stress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Pay out of pocket for professional development.</strong></p>
<p>We get it! The added expense of <a href="http://go.ncpan.org/2017NNTDRTP">National Nanny Training Day: Research Triangle Park</a> means you&#8217;d have to miss out. But did you know that nannies rarely pay their own way? <em>EMPLOYERS PAY!</em> <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/professional-development/48594">Here&#8217;s how you get your bosses to send you.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Don&#8217;t stand up for themselves.</strong></p>
<p>A common theme on nanny support groups is the nanny who says, &#8220;Yeah, <em>I know I shouldn&#8217;t let them walk all over me</em>, but &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>If this resonates with you, know that you aren&#8217;t alone. The first step to developing assertiveness <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/professional-development/48678">is here</a>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Free yourself from these mistakes! Start, by <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/2017-nntdrtp">attending National Nanny Training Day: Research Triangle Park</a> with us later this month.</h1>

<p>Emily Haas is a Kukkiwon certified second degree black belt at White Tiger Taekwondo and Martial Arts in Cary, NC.  In addition to training, she competes in taekwondo competitions locally, nationally, and internationally, and is a state champion and two time national medalist.  She also co-coaches White Tiger’s Cadet Poomsae Team, is a certified wellness consultant (AFPA), and cross trains in parkour.  When she’s not focusing on taekwondo, Coach Emily spends time at her day job as a patent attorney.</p>
<p>Emily Haas will be the <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/2017-nntdrtp">National Nanny Training Day: Research Triangle Park 2017</a> assertiveness speaker. But you&#8217;ll only see her if <a href="http://go.ncpan.org/2017NNTDRTP">you have a ticket</a>. Do you?</p>
<p>Join us! <a href="http://go.ncpan.org/2017NNTDRTP">Ticket packages start at just $35 (meals included)</a>. Or perhaps you need to <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/2017-nntdrtp">learn more</a>, first?</p>
