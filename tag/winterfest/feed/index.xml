<p>It is once again time for NC PAN members to make their voices heard during <strong>our annual All Members meeting</strong>. This year, we are being generously hosted in the Zoom of one of our <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/membership-account/membership-checkout?level=2" data-type="URL" data-id="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/membership-account/membership-checkout?level=2">Agency Affiliates</a>. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1057500064713955" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.facebook.com/events/1057500064713955">You must be RSVPed as &#8220;going&#8221; to receive the joining information.</a> If you don&#8217;t have a Facebook account, send an email to <a href="mailto:winterfest2020@ncpan.org">winterfest2020@ncpan.org</a> with your yes-RSVP and we&#8217;ll send you the information via email.</p>



<p>Our holiday gathering for nannies and those they love, this year, will be on <strong>December 19th </strong>from<strong> 5:30 to 9 pm</strong>. </p>



<p><strong>All Members Meeting</strong>, limited to <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/product/promember" data-type="product" data-id="42361">supporting members</a>, will begin at <strong>5:30 pm</strong>, promptly, as we have a lot to cover. Reports will be given by all of the board members, and your feedback will be solicited. How do you want NC PAN to serve you in 2021?</p>



<p>Following that meeting, from <strong>5:45 pm to 6 pm</strong> is the <strong>awarding of the earned memberships to those who went above and beyond in this pandemic</strong>. If you have someone to nominate, you have until the 17th of December to nominate them for inclusion in this award ceremony. <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/uncategorized/50488">Read about that award, here.</a> Anyone is invited to attend and cheer for these Superstar Nannies.</p>



<p>And finally from <strong>6-9 pm</strong> will be <strong>a party for EVERYONE</strong>: nanny, nanny-adjacent, or just a nanny-supporter!</p>



<p>Here is a brief outline of the schedule:<br /><strong>6 &#8211; 7 pm</strong>: Agency Affiliate party hour; there will be prizes!<br /><strong>7 &#8211; 9 pm</strong>: Nanny movie with a drinking game (water, naturally) to make sure we all stay hydrated.<br /><strong>9 pm</strong>: Goodbyes.</p>



<p>So join us to retire 2020 in grand, nanny-budget-friendly fashion while we welcome 2021 with eager anticipation of it fulfilling your needs!</p>
