<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Work-From-Home Courtesy: As much as possible, parents working from home will separate their work space from the children&#8217;s play, sleep and eating spaces. Parents working from home while Nanny is present agree to respect Nanny&#8217;s authority and refer the child back to her if they ask for something. Parents agree to limit time spent in the child&#8217;s presence during the day to minimize separation anxiety and help the nanny maintain a predictable routine. When parents do need to be present during Nanny&#8217;s shift, it is important to communicate with the child about what to expect rather than &#8220;popping in and out&#8221; without warning. If the child becomes upset at the parents&#8217; departure (which should be quick and definitive, not prolonged), the parents will allow Nanny to take over and offer comfort. The parents agree to be responsible for ensuring that their home work space is functional and free from disruption by making modifications to the home environment and will not expect Nanny to keep the children quiet or restrict their movement to prevent disruption.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Here is a sample text to send to your employer(s) when you discover that they are underpaying you and that you could have benefits.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>MomBoss and DadBoss,</p>



<p>I understand that you have concerns for the cost of childcare and I am happy to discuss. </p>



<p>I am thinking that maybe a Nanny is not the best fit for your family, but I am happy to work with you to find a balance that meets both of our needs. </p>



<p>As this is my full time job, I&#8217;m sure you can understand that I bring a skill set and I do work that is vital to helping you raise your child. This is no small task. While I love what I do, the purpose of work for me, and for anyone, is to make a living. In an ideal world we could all do what we love and do it for free, but in a realistic world we build our skill sets so that we can work jobs and make a fair and decent, livable wage. In North Carolina, the minimum wage is $[min wage]. Thanks to the Fair Labor Standards Act, it is also a requirement to be paid hourly, and to be paid overtime. </p>



<p>All this said, I would like to point out that my skill set and resume does show my value to have a rate closer to $[market rate]/hr. </p>



<p>I recognize that by not addressing this at the time of hire this situation is a little difficult, so I&#8217;m willing to discuss the minimum wage for the time being. With minimum wage for my hourly rate, and taking overtime over 40 hours into account, my guaranteed weekly paycheck moving forward will equal $[new total]. As is industry standard, this means when I am available to work and you do not need me, I will still earn this amount, due to holding my availability open for your needs long-term. In terms of my own personal time off, it is industry standard to get the equivalent of 1 week of sick time, and 1 week of vacation time. </p>



<p>Please look at each of your paychecks and benefits packages and consider what it would be like to work without these things. </p>



<p>My career is a Nanny. It may be different than your career, but it is still my job and things like a living wage, overtime, and personal time off are the bare minimum of benefits a full time work deserves to make. Moving forward until December 31, my weekly rate will be at $[new total] for [scheduled number of hours] hours, with any hours over being paid at the overtime rate of $[overtime rate]/hr. </p>



<p>At January 1 my rate will fairly move to $[market rate]/hr, with 1 week paid sick time and 1 week paid vacation of my choice. If this is not attainable for you, my last day will be December 31. </p>



<p>I will need this decision by November 15.</p>



<p>Happy to sit down and discuss more if needed. Thank you for your understanding.</p>



<p>*your name*</p>

<p>MomBoss and DadBoss,</p>



<p>There seems to be some confusion about what I was hired to do and what you want me to do. As you can see from the comparison between my hiring contract and your latest set of instructions, I am being asked to do things outside of my scope of duties. For now, I will be sticking to my contracted obligations, but if we need to have a conversation about modifying the contract for additional duty pay, I am happy to meet with you at a time convenient for both of us.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way we started getting away from my original job duties, and I realized the other day how much more I had taken on. If you&#8217;d like me to do more, can we discuss what pay looks like for those extra duties? I&#8217;m of course happy to do what&#8217;s within my job duties as agreed.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Here are some phrases to help get through this insane career.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>That&#8217;s not the market rate for my experience, referencs, and qualifications. Unfortunately I can&#8217;t accept that rate.</li>



<li>I would like that in writing.</li>



<li>Let&#8217;s discuss what guaranteed hours looks like over the course of an average year.</li>



<li>Does your child have any behavioral struggles that could end in injury to myself or require professional training to handle?</li>



<li>That violates my personal code of ethics and my position as a mandatory reporter, so we need to find a different solution for the time when the child is under my care.</li>



<li>That&#8217;s not within my scope of work.</li>



<li>This constitutes an unsafe work environment for me.</li>



<li>Changes to the original contract will have to be written down and resigned by both of us.</li>



<li>If you would like me to get that training I can either save the receipt for reimbursement or you can pay the training facility directly.</li>



<li>I don&#8217;t tolerate abusive work relationships, so if you feel the need to raise your voice to me, I&#8217;ll need to leave and seek out more professional employment.</li>



<li>Daycare is certainly cheaper and that&#8217;s an option you&#8217;re more than welcome to pursue. If a nanny isn&#8217;t in your budget, I won&#8217;t be upset.</li>



<li>Just so you know, hiring me will involve household employee taxes and to provide a W2. Do you have a plan for handling that?</li>



<li>I don&#8217;t drive children in my car unless I&#8217;m compensated for the milage.</li>



<li>I don&#8217;t drive/won&#8217;t come in snow/hurricanes/floods/etc.</li>



<li>I&#8217;ll only communicate in group chats. I don&#8217;t text the fathers of children in secret or private chats.</li>



<li>I know you want them to hit this milestone, but there is such a thing as a developmentally appropriate approach. Do you trust me and my experience to take the lead on this during the day?</li>



<li>Sometimes I will have to tell your child no and correct a behavior. I believe in being gentle, but firm. Can we maintain consistency during the week with this?</li>



<li>My free time is not the same thing as my availability.</li>



<li>If you want to pay me cash outside of my payroll hours, I still have to right to charge you overtime pay.</li>



<li>You&#8217;re a great parent and you&#8217;re doing an amazing job. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>



<li>Child related only is a Nanny position. Family related is a household manager/family assistant, which costs more per hour. If you&#8217;d like to discuss further please let me know.</li>

<p>Mileage reimbursement actually isn&#8217;t a negotiable factor within this industry-the IRS determines the rate of mileage reimbursement based on gas prices and the wear it puts upon the car. Currently, the rate is [current IRS rate] cents per mile. If you&#8217;d like to do away with the mileage reimbursement, I&#8217;m happy to use a family vehicle so you can handle gas and car repairs privately.</p>

<p>I was unfortunately 5 minutes late this morning. I apologized at the time (if you gave them a heads up, reference that here). This has not been a pattern, as I am generally punctual. While I am able to stay until [end time] today, that is not always the case as it is not our agreed upon schedule. Shifting the end time without consulting me, especially as a reaction to the rare delay that occurred this morning is not appropriate.</p>



<p>Moving forward, I will do my best to continue being punctual, and I expect to be paid for the extra ten minutes you&#8217;ve planned to tack on to today.</p>

<p>This has been quite the learning experience for all of us. Going forward, I will not be traveling in dangerous weather conditions- not even in an Uber as accidents can still happen even if I am not behind the wheel. If the forecast says to stay off of the roads due to dangerous conditions I will not be coming in. These are also paid days off due to inclement weather. Thanks for understanding.</p>
