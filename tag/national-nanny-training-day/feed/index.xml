<p>Because we are still battling CoViD-19 and some places are heading into additional lockdowns while there are also group gathering restrictions still in place, the official international stance on interNational Nanny Training Day is to hold an entirely virtual/online asynchronous training day this year (April 17th; this Saturday). In addition, there will be a group live-stream on 17th April 2021 if OnDemand (asynchronous) doesn&#8217;t work for you. The asynchronous recordings will be available until 2nd May 2021. Plus, registered attendees will have access to a private Facebook group with additional content.</p>

<p>So what does this have to do with National Nanny Recognition Week? Well, if you&#8217;ll look at our <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/national-nanny-recognition-week#schedule">schedule of events</a> on <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/national-nanny-recognition-week" data-type="page" data-id="46569">the NC PAN National Nanny Recognition Week page</a>, you&#8217;ll see that every Saturday of NNRW, NannyCast provides the nanny-themed add-on pack to everyone for free as a NNRW treat. So you&#8217;ll be helping yourself learn and helping yourself play!</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll notice that our calendar looks a little bit different this year. That&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve had to swap in-person events for remote events. Hopefully those remote events will still prove enjoyable enough that we&#8217;ll all have fun attending!</p>

<p>In light of the measures put in place to &#8220;flatten the curve&#8221; to prevent an overload of high risk patients in hospitals, several of the North Carolina interNational Nanny Training Days have canceled or postponed. This post will keep a running tally of which days have done what, by alphabetical order of city. As always, <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=2u6mpgcko0qgcnepj726977a4c%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/New_York">the North Carolina Nanny Calendar</a> will be kept as accurate as possible.</p>



<p>Please keep in mind that venues and registration sites are not being as flexible with the current health emergency as we would like them to be, so if you are in the position to financially enable these event hosts to survive in order to provide quality training, please let them know that you are able to forego a refund or willing to accept a partial refund to compensate for deposit losses. No one is running interNational Nanny Training Day to make a profit. For your generosity, <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/">North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies</a> is awarding registered attendees of these events a gratis (that means free) <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/product/promember">year of membership</a>! Your event host will be able to provide you details of how to take advantage of that, if they haven&#8217;t already.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes it can be daunting to ask your employer to sponsor your admission to interNational Nanny Training Day. It is a lot easier when the <a href="http://www.ncpan.org/" rel="nofollow">North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies</a> makes the suggestion. We understand. We are nannies, too.</p>
<p>We are more than happy to send an email to your employers informing them of interNational Nanny Training Day&nbsp;and making a case for why they should pay to send you. All we ask in return is that you provide us with a way to reach your employer(s).</p>
<p>We will use this information ONLY to reach out to them about this year&#8217;s&nbsp;interNational Nanny Training Day, and only reach out to them once. We will not save, sell, or otherwise misuse this information. It is important and, as nannies ourselves, we take our own employer&#8217;s contact information very seriously, so we will extend the same courtesy to yours. (Plus, we have a great track record of meaning what we say about this &#8212; just look at our <a href="http://www.ncpan.org/national-nanny-recognition-week.html" rel="nofollow">National Nanny Recognition Week</a> postcards!)</p>
<p>Help us help you!</p>




<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rather do it yourself?</h2>



<p>Use <a href="http://www.ncpan.org/professional-development/why-employers-should-pay-for-nntdrtp-2015">this handy flyer</a> as an icebreaker for a great conversation! Then point your employer(s) to <a href="http://www.nannypalooza.com/nntd-events-by-city.html">the national listing of interNational Nanny Training Days</a> to complete the ticket purchase process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Immediate Release.</p>
<p>North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies has become known as the organization who hosts National Nanny Training Day: Research Triangle Park. This began in 2014 when Lora Brawley, the original administrator of National Nanny Training Day, asked us to take on this important event in the absence of a willing host. This privilege continued under the authority of current NNTD advisor, Sue Downey.</p>
<p>We offered the Research Triangle Park edition of National Nanny Training Day for the past three years, both with excitement and as the area lacked a ready and eager alternative.</p>
<p>For 2018, we are pleased that a local agency has requested to host National Nanny Training Day: Research Triangle Park. We could not be more thrilled! They have our full support and well wishes for producing a great event for the nannies of the Triangle area.</p>
<p>This frees up a considerable amount of NC PAN volunteer resources to provide quality professional development across the whole of North Carolina throughout 2018 and beyond. This better fits our mission as a nanny professional development organization. We look forward to seeing you at a workshop training near you in the coming year!</p>
<p>In addition, the North Carolina Professional Association of Nannies is pleased to offer our support to any and all National Nanny Training Day events throughout North Carolina. We are available to contribute door prizes, membership information, and our three years of organizer expertise. Please do get in touch!</p>
<p>We hope to see you at your areaâ€™s National Nanny Training Day in April!</p>

<p><strong>1. This is the month, and you still don&#8217;t have <a href="http://go.ncpan.org/2017NNTDRTP">your ticket</a> to National Nanny Training Day: Research Triangle Park!</strong></p>
<p>You are going to miss out!</p>
<p>Meeting other nannies overÂ our networking lunch sponsored by <a href="http://mygirlfri.com/">My Girl Friday</a>,Â is a great way to build up your professional network. You can rely on your professional network for coverage on days when you are sick or traveling. Plus, playdates with fellow nannies are always great!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Put the needs of others before your own.</strong></p>
<p>This is <em>exhausting</em>! Compassion fatigue is tiring and once you are in its clutches, it isn&#8217;t easy to break out. Luckily, <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/professional-development/48584">we have just the woman for the job</a>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Live paycheck to paycheck.</strong></p>
<p>Not only does that add stress to your life, but can add tension to the employer-employee relationship. Attending <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/2017-nntdrtp/nntd-schedule">our session on Financial Fitness</a> can free you from that stress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.Â Pay out of pocket forÂ professional development.</strong></p>
<p>We get it! The added expense of <a href="http://go.ncpan.org/2017NNTDRTP">National Nanny Training Day: Research Triangle Park</a> means you&#8217;d have to miss out. But did you know that nannies rarely pay their own way? <em>EMPLOYERS PAY!</em> <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/professional-development/48594">Here&#8217;s how you get your bosses to send you.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Don&#8217;t stand up for themselves.</strong></p>
<p>A common theme on nanny support groups is the nanny who says, &#8220;Yeah, <em>I know I shouldn&#8217;t let them walk all over me</em>, but &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>If this resonates with you, know that you aren&#8217;t alone. The first step to developing assertiveness <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/professional-development/48678">is here</a>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Free yourself from these mistakes! Start, by <a href="https://theinfamousj.github.io/ncpan/2017-nntdrtp">attending National Nanny Training Day: Research Triangle Park</a> with us later this month.</h1>
